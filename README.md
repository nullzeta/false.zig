# How to?
## Build
You need some compiler that speaks Zig.
If you decide to edit the source code, you will need a compatible editor. As of today, the only two i know of are [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) and [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim).
### Microsoft Windows support
Haven't tested myself. Hope it doesn't work.
## Run
You need to be inside [fish shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) to run false.zig.
